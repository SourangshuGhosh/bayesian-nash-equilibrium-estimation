## Summary and Findings

Which beer would Thomas Bayes, the famous philosopher and statistician that first
described Bayes’ Theorem (Bayes 1763) prefer? Though a particular preference by
Bayes for a certain product cannot be inferred and this question remains unanswered
by the present study, modern Bayesian methods provide a sophisticated way to estimate
today’s customers’ individual preferences based on their choices. This paper
uses Bayesian methods applied on choice-based conjoint (CBC) data to simulate Nash
equilibrium market outcomes in the beer market. The remainder is structured as follows:
First, this section introduces the beer market and the assumptions necessary for
further analysis. Then, section 2 motivates the analytical model, while chapter 3 introduces
the data set and hypothesizes the expected relationships between the market
simulation metrics. The paper then introduces the heterogeneous MNL model with
BLP-type indirect utilities and presents its results (section 4), followed by a discussion
of the resulting beer market simulation. The last section concludes by discussing
managerial and research implications that can be derived from the present analysis.

The implications resulting from this market simulation can be divided into two parts:
The first one discusses managerial ones, while the second part outlines suggestions
for further research, especially in terms of model enhancement. Taking a look at the
Heineken-Amstel merger from the producer’s side, it generated an incremental profit
of 3.5%. This increase in profits is solely due to higher market power and the thereby
increased ability to raise prices. Furthermore, a merger would potentially also reduce
costs due to synergies, thus even increase the profits by a larger margin. It is important
to note that both players in the market benefited from the consolidation. Even the
outside party in this merger, Estrella, increased their profits compared to the scenario
with three players in the market. This indicates that in this case, Estrella’s prices
can be raised with less competition—even though Estrella’s market power decreased
relatively compared to the new Heineken–Amstel company.

With the present model and derived prices as well as market shares, it is straightforward
to compute the producer surplus as the sum of individual profits. Also, average prices
considerably increase with a higher degree of market consolidation. Consumer surplus
can therefore be assumed to decrease. Contrary to the producer surplus, the implemented
methodology can however not quantify the consumer surplus for the market
simulation. When deciding whether to approve a merger of two firms from the regulator’s
point-of-view, economic theory argues that the overall welfare should increase
(Perry & Porter 1985). If the producers’ gains in terms of surplus outweigh the losses in
consumer surplus then, strictly from an economic standpoint, the merger increases welfare
and should be approved. However, if consumers’ losses were higher than producers’
additional surplus, the merger would be welfare decreasing and should be prohibited.
Unfortunately, this study cannot infer any statements about this since the consumer
surplus cannot be calculated with the implemented methodology. So far, no study
known to the author derives consumer welfare from a MNL model in combination with
BLP-type indirect utilities. Future research should therefore combine BLP’s approach
to account for budgets in MNL models with the methodology to derive consumer surplus
from those models as proposed by Train (2015). Weighing the losses and gains
against each other would then enable well-informed decisions by regulatory authorities
whether to accept or reject a merger based on welfare calculations.
