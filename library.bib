  volume = {6},
  issn = {0735-0015},
  abstract = {Aggregate forecasts using McFadden's conditional logit model of discrete choice harbor the unrealistic implicit assumption of a random-utility distribution that is homogeneous across both alternatives and individuals. This article relaxes that assumption. A choice model is developed that describes the random-utility component as a probability-mixture model. Some numerical results illustrate that the derived model is not constrained by the independence-of-irrelevant-alternatives property. An experimental test of visual perceptions demonstrates the potential superiority of the model.},

  abstract = {This article describes numerical methods that exploit fixed-point equations equivalent to the first-order condition for Bertrand-Nash equilibrium prices in a class of differentiated product market models based on the mixed-logit model of demand. One fixed-point equation is already prevalent in the literature, and one is novel. Equilibrium prices are computed for the calendar year 2005 new-vehicle market under two mixed-logit models using (i) a state-of-the-art variant of Newton's method applied to the first-order conditions as well as the two fixed-point equations and (ii) a fixed-point iteration generated by our novel fixed-point equation. A comparison of the performance of these methods for a simple model with multiple equilibria is also provided. The analysis and trials illustrate the importance of using fixed-point forms of the first-order conditions for efficient and reliable computations of equilibrium prices.},

The procedures are useful in many settings, such as the assessment of damages for false advertising and the analysis of informational policies.},
