  abstract = {Aggregate forecasts using McFadden's conditional logit model of discrete choice harbor the unrealistic implicit assumption of a random-utility distribution that is homogeneous across both alternatives and individuals. This article relaxes that assumption. A choice model is developed that describes the random-utility component as a probability-mixture model. Some numerical results illustrate that the derived model is not constrained by the independence-of-irrelevant-alternatives property. An experimental test of visual perceptions demonstrates the potential superiority of the model.},

This paper describes, and illustrates with several examples, the calculation of consumer surplus in this situation and the loss in consumer surplus due to the imperfect foreknowledge about attributes. The procedures are useful in many settings, such as the assessment of damages for false advertising and the analysis of informational policies.},

@article{pachaliHowGeneralizeHierarchical2017,
  title = {How to {{Generalize}} from a {{Hierarchical Model}}?},
  issn = {1556-5068},
  abstract = {In many marketing applications of hierarchical models the goal is to inform actions that apply to the population of consumers beyond the sample available for calibration; the goal is to generalize to the population, an exercise often referred to as market simulation. Examples are price and product optimization based on household scanner panel data or data from discrete choice experiments. It is common practice to rely on the collection of individual level posterior mean preferences of in-sample respondents, or consumers, as a representation of population preferences in this context. We show that this results in biased inferences and misleading recommendations precisely in situations that call for a hierarchical model. Generalizations that avoid this bias rely heavily on the hierarchical prior distribution, which is often only regarded as a smoothing device but not as a useful model per se. We show how to specify more economically faithful hierarchical prior distributions based on prior constraints and a marginal-conditional decomposition for the hierarchical prior distribution, and how to efficiently sample from the implied posterior. Practical relevance is demonstrated in two empirical case studies.},
